Monte Carlo ensembles
#####################

Uncertainty quantification is incorporated at a fundamental level in Aether 
by making Monte Carlo ensemble simulations standard. Users can specify a
default range of acceptable parameters, coefficient, rates, and drivers.

Users can modify the ensemble input by specifying which parameters,
coefficients, rates, and driver indices they would like to vary and how many
ensemble members they would like to create.

Post processing codes store raw ensemble members, create mean states, standard
deviations, and statistical analyses that provide confidence levels.
