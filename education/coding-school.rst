Coding school
#############

The Aether :doc:`/contributing/core-team` runs a coding school that offers
multiple levels of training on software and model development. The school is
logically scaled in experience level as a function of time, so that users who
know nothing about using models can attend the early days of the school, while
more experienced users who would like to start contributing can attend later
days of the school.

Student hackathons are also conducted to add new features to the model.
Overlapping of experience levels allows users/contributors to interact and
optimize training and development.

Sustainability of the coding school is promoted by encouraging students from
previous years to act as assistants and then as teachers.

Wider community involvement is encouraged through the creation and
dissemination of online training courses and videos.

These materials are developed by undergraduate and graduate students. They
introduce relatively simple concepts to students and other new users, allowing
them to rapidly climb the steep learning curve involved in using a model like
Aether.

These tutorials are directed towards undergraduates and beginning graduate
students with topics including logging into NASA and NSF computing resources
for the first time, managing the queue system, checking out and configuring the
model, submitting jobs, post processing, and making plots. These are simple
tutorials, but the topics contained within are either not available or not
easily discoverable.
