.. note::

   I'm skipping extensive documentation of this subdirectory since it isn't 
   immediately relevant to the project. My hunch is that ``pp*`` stands for 
   physics package, but I'm not sure if that's true.

Contains many subdirectories for computing chemistry: 

- ``aerosol``
- ``bulk_aero``
- ``modal_aero``
- ``mozart``
- ``pp_none``
- ``pp_terminator``
- ``pp_trop_mam3``
- ``pp_trop_mam4``
- ``pp_trop_mam7``
- ``pp_trop_mozart``
- ``pp_trop_strat_mam4_ts2``
- ``pp_trop_strat_mam4_vbs``
- ``pp_trop_strat_mam4_vbsext``
- ``pp_waccm_ma``
- ``pp_waccm_ma_mam4``
- ``pp_waccm_ma_sulfur``
- ``pp_waccm_mad``
- ``pp_waccm_mad_mam4``
- ``pp_waccm_sc``
- ``pp_waccm_sc_mam4``
- ``pp_waccm_tsmlt_mam4``
- ``utils``
