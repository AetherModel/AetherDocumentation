.. important::

   Oftentimes it seems that the documentation from CESM1.X is more
   comprehensive than the current
   `CESM2.X documentation <https://ncar.github.io/CAM/doc/build/html/index.html>`_.
   For example, this `CESM1.2 Physics Driver <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/cam/docs/rm5_3/ch04.html>`_ 
   page doesn't seem to have an analog in the CESM2.X documentation.
