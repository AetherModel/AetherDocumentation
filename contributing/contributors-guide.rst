Contributing source code
========================

Aether is an open-source model that welcomes your contributions. 
If you want to contribute to the project, you should be familiar with the 
standard GitHub `fork and pull request workflow
<https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_.
These are the basic steps involved in the workflow.

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Checkout a feature branch
4. Make changes, commit them, and push them to your fork
5. Make a pull request

GitHub instructional tutorials
==============================

Many universities provide their faculty, staff and students access to
instructional materials from LinkedIn Learning. Two videos from this service
are useful for learning the basics of git and GitHub:

- `Git Essential Training <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-essential-training-the-basics>`_
- `Git Branches, Merges, and Remotes <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/git-branches-merges-and-remotes>`_
