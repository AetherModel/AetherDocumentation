C and C++ compilers
===================

The `GNU compiler collection <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ provides compilers for C
and C++.

Python
======

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is an interpreted language, meaning it
doesn't need to be compiled.

NetCDF
======

The `Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)
<https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/>`_ is a set of software
libraries created by Unidata.
